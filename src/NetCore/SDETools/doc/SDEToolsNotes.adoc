== Analysis :

For the moment there are 3 interesting projects:

* AbstractDataHelper -> Working with collections + serializations to and from files

* File helper -> Line changer

* FileAndFolderHelper -> There is two complicated. Could be interesting to create an in memory File and Folder structure (to avoid to reload every time from HDD).



== Next Step

Cleanup libraries + create small useful classes
